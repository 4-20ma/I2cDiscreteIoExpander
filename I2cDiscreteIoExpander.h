/// \mainpage Arduino library for TI PCF8575C 16-bit I2C I/O expander.
/// 
/// The PCF8575C provides general-purpose remote I/O expansion for most
/// microcontroller families via the I2C interface serial clock (SCL) and
/// serial data (SDA).<br>
/// 
/// The device features a 16-bit quasi-bidirectional input/output (I/O) port
/// (P07..P00, P17..P10), including latched outputs with high-current drive
/// capability for directly driving LEDs. Each quasi-bidirectional I/O can
/// be used as an input or output without the use of a data-direction
/// control signal. At power on, the I/Os are in 3-state mode. The strong
/// pullup to VCC allows fast-rising edges into heavily loaded outputs. This
/// device turns on when an output is written high and is switched off by
/// the negative edge of SCL. The I/Os should be high before being used as
/// inputs. After power on, as all the I/Os are set to 3-state, all of them
/// can be used as inputs. Any change in setting of the I/Os as either
/// inputs or outputs can be done with the write mode. If a high is applied
/// externally to an I/O that has been written earlier to low, a large
/// current (IOL) flows to GND.<br>
/// 
/// The fixed I2C address of the PCF8575C is the same as the PCF8575,
/// PCF8574, PCA9535, and PCA9555, allowing up to eight of these devices,
/// in any combination, to share the same I2C bus or SMBus.
