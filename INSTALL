INSTALL

Determine the location of your sketchbook by selecting File > 
Preferences from within the Arduino IDE. If you don't already have a 
libraries folder within your sketchbook, create one and unzip the 
archive there. See http://arduino.cc/blog/?p=313 for more information. 

Note: Arduino 1.0 or later is required.
